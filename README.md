🕹️ Word Catcher Game (Assembly Language)

This is a simple Word Catcher game developed in NASM (x86 Assembly language), where a user moves a catcher (like a bucket or character) left or right to catch falling words or characters on the screen.

🎯 Objective

The player controls a catcher that moves horizontally. The goal is to catch the falling word or character before it hits the bottom of the screen. Each successful catch can increase your score or prevent game over.

🧠 How It Works (Simplified)

If the word lands on the catcher, it's a success.
If the word misses the catcher, you may lose a life or the game ends.
